# Gen-Mix: Intergenerational Play Experience

Gen-Mix is an interactive project designed to foster intergenerational connections in a museum setting through collaborative play and shared storytelling. The experience leverages game-themed interactions and discussions to create a unique and memorable visit for participants of all ages.

This prototype was created during the 2024 Swiss edition of the Museomix creative hackathon, at the [Swiss Museum of Games](https://museedujeu.ch/) in La Tour de Peilz. For more info about this event, check out: https://https://www.museomix.ch/museomix-2024/.

1. **Activation of the Digital Spin Wheel:**
   - Visitors, typically in intergenerational groups (two or more people), begin their experience by pressing a button on an interactive screen.
   - This action activates a digital spin wheel that randomly stops on one of the possible themes (e.g., "Outdoor Games", "Board Games", "Adventure Games").
   - The selected theme is displayed on the screen.

2. **Observation of Objects:**
   - Based on the selected theme, participants explore a set-up featuring 25 iconic game objects from various eras.

3. **Selection of Objects:**
   - Each participant chooses one or more objects that resonate with them, whether due to personal memories or preferences.
   - The selection prompts a discussion about each object, allowing participants to exchange experiences, share memories, and explain their choices.

4. **Scanning the Chosen Objects:**
   - Once the objects are selected, each participant scans the barcode on their chosen items.
   - The scan records each person's choices and links them back to the theme chosen by the spin wheel.

5. **Validation of Collection and Explanations:**
   - After all objects are scanned, participants are prompted to validate their choices on the screen.
   - This validation creates a collection of chosen objects and reveals the original items in the museum's collections that correspond to the scanned pieces (e.g., the Indian Pachisi game from 1841 for the small horse piece), along with a brief explanation.

6. **Printing Explanations and the Map:**
   - Visitors have the option to print a receipt with a map of the museum, highlighting the objects from their created collection and the associated descriptions. This allows them to view the actual items and continue their conversation within the museum. [Demo functionality, not coded]
